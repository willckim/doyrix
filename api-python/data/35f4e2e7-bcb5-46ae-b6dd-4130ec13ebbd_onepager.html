          <li>Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS</li>
        
          <li>- Financial results may vary significantly period-to-period due to fluctuations in operating costs tied to product design, development and manufacturing activities, and capacity expansion; quarter-to-quarter comparisons are not necessarily meaningful. [p475]  </li>
        
          <li>- Operating-cost volatility is driven by non‑linear pacing of designing, developing and manufacturing new products and by expanding current facilities and adding future manufacturing facilities. [p475]  </li>
        
          <li>- Revenue volatility is driven by timing of introducing existing products into new markets and the development/introduction cadence of new products, creating uneven top‑line performance between periods. [p475]  </li>
        
          <li>- We acknowledge guidance risk: identifying key factors and predicting future events is inherently uncertain, so we may fail to meet publicly announced guidance or market expectations. [p475]  </li>
        
          <li>- Material market impact: missed guidance or short‑term underperformance relative to analysts/ investors could cause a substantial decline in our stock price, either suddenly or over time. [p475]</li>

          <li>- Cybersecurity risk identification and assessment are integrated into the firm’s overall risk‑management systems and processes (business, technical operations, privacy, compliance) [p476].  </li>
        
          <li>- Risk‑management/control activities are “multi‑faceted”: third‑party assessments, internal IT Audit, IT security functions, and governance/risk/compliance reviews are used to identify and address vulnerabilities [p476].  </li>
        
          <li>- Defensive, detective and responsive measures include proactive privacy/cybersecurity reviews, data‑policy audits, external penetration testing, a bug‑bounty program, employee training, and monitoring of emerging data‑protection laws with subsequent changes implemented [p476].  </li>
        
          <li>- Incident response and breach‑management are formalized into four interconnected stages (including preparation; detection and analysis), indicating a structured playbook for handling incidents [p476].</li>
