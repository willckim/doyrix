      <ul style="line-height:1.5;padding-left:1.1rem;">
        
          <li>- 2023 output and deliveries: produced 1,845,985 consumer vehicles and delivered 1,808,581 consumer vehicles; company priority is to further increase production, capacity and delivery capabilities. [p480]</li>
        
          <li>- Current production footprint and model status: Fremont (Model S/X, Model 3/Y active), Gigafactory Shanghai (Model 3/Y active), Berlin-Brandenburg (Model Y active), Texas (Model Y, Cybertruck active), Nevada (Tesla Semi pilot production), various sites (Next Generation Platform and Roadster in development). [p481]</li>
        
          <li>- Key growth levers: ramp existing factories to installed capacity, introduce next-generation platform, and add battery cell supply by manufacturing in‑house high‑volume, lower‑cost cells to improve range and reduce vehicle costs. [p481]</li>
        
          <li>- Operational constraints and execution risks: delivery capability must scale with production to avoid bottlenecks; reducing the share of vehicles delivered in the third month of each quarter is a stated cost-reduction target; staffing of delivery, service and charging infrastructure and maintaining reliability are material execution risks. [p482]</li>
        
          <li>- Energy storage posture and timing risk: increasing energy storage production (new Megafactory in Shanghai, ramp at Lathrop) to capture demand, but Megapack deployments can vary meaningfully quarter‑to‑quarter based on project milestones, creating short‑term revenue/ margin variability.

    <h2>Top Risks</h2>
    
      <ul style="line-height:1.5;padding-left:1.1rem;">
        
          <li>Our information technology systems or data, or those of our service providers or customers or users could be 
subject to cyber-attacks or other security incidents, which could result in data breaches, intellectual property 
theft, claims, litigation, regulatory investigations, significant liability, reputational damage and other adverse 
consequences. [p468]</li>
        
          <li>In addition, certain privacy laws are still subject to a high degree of uncertainty as to their 
interpretation, application and impact, and may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to 
implement, increase our operating costs, adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer, or 
result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation. [p473]</li>
        
          <li>As a result, the market for 
our vehicles could be negatively affected by numerous factors, such as: 
•
perceptions about electric vehicle features, quality, safety, performance and cost;
•
perceptions about the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge, and 
access to charging facilities; 
•
competition, including from other types of alternative fuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and high 
fuel-economy internal combustion engine vehicles; 
•
volatility in the cost of oil, gasoline and energy; 
•
government regulations and economic incentives and conditions; and
•
concerns about our future viability. [p464]</li>
        
          <li>We are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, political uncertainty and social, environmental and economic 
conditions in numerous jurisdictions, including markets in which we generate significant sales, over which we have little 
control and which are inherently unpredictable. [p465]</li>
        
          <li>Maintaining such confidence may be challenging due to our limited operating history relative to established competitors; 
customer unfamiliarity with our products; any delays we may experience in scaling manufacturing, delivery and service 
operations to meet demand; competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles or our other products and 
services; our quarterly production and sales performance compared with market expectations; and other factors including 
those over which we have no control. [p466]</li>
        
          <li>The profitability of any directly-leased vehicles returned to us at the end of their leases depends on our ability to 
accurately project our vehicles’ residual values at the outset of the leases, and such values may fluctuate prior to the end of 
their terms depending on various factors such as supply and demand of our used vehicles, economic cycles and the pricing 
of new vehicles. [p466]</li>
        
          <li>Substantial expenses and 
operational changes may be required in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws, and even an unsuccessful 
challenge by customers or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly 
response from and defense by us. [p473]</li>
        
          <li>Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be 
immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. [p461]</li>
        
          <li>The trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide 
fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. [p474]</li>
        
          <li>We may incur expenses or delays relating to such events outside of our control, 
which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. [p472]</li>
