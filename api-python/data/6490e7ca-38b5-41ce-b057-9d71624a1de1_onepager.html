      <ul style="line-height:1.35; padding-left:1.1rem;">

          <li>- They concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a “reasonable assurance” level for timely recording, processing, summarizing and reporting of required SEC information. [p540]  </li>
        
          <li>- Management explicitly notes that “reasonable assurance” is not absolute — controls are subject to inherent limitations, resource constraints and judgment-based cost/benefit tradeoffs. [p540]  </li>

          <li>- Management, with participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a‑15 under the Exchange Act [p540].  </li>
        
          <li>- As of December 31, 2023, the CEO and CFO concluded the disclosure controls were designed at a “reasonable assurance” level and were effective to ensure required information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within SEC time periods [p540].  </li>
        
          <li>- Controls are intended to accumulate and communicate required information to management, including the CEO and CFO, for inclusion in Exchange Act reports [p540].  </li>
        
          <li>- Management expressly notes inherent limitations: controls can provide only reasonable (not absolute) assurance and their design reflects resource constraints and judgment about control costs versus benefits [p540].  </li>
        
          <li>- Item 9 reports no changes in, and no disagreements with, accountants on accounting and financial disclosure (stated as “None”)—indicative of continuity in the external audit relationship [p540].</li>
